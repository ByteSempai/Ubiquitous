<h2>FluorineFx.Hosting.HostManager</h2>

<p>
The HostManager object sits on top of all running FluorineFx application AppDomains and can be used to manage the applications.<br />
Each application is hosted in its own Application Domain.
</p>

<h2>Setting up the runtime environment</h2>
<p>
The runtime uses the "applications" subdirectory as its base directory.<br />
However it is possible to use the StartApplication method with any physical path (the directory name itself will act like a virtual directory on a Web server).
</p>

<h2>HostManager summary</h2>

<p><b>HostManager.Start</b></p>
<p>The Start method will initialize the host.</p>

<p><b>HostManager.Stop</b></p>
<p>The Stop method will shutdown all the running applications.</p>

<p><b>HostManager.StartApplication</b></p>
<p>Starts a new application from the specified physical path (full path to the application folder)</p>

<p><b>HostManager.StopApplication</b></p>
<p>
